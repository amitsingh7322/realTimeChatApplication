Zustand - kind of store, we are using as alternative of context


what is usestate
-> useState is a React Hook , It allows functional components to have local state,
   enabling them to manage and update stateful data.
  -> The useState Hook is a function that takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an array with two elements:
1. The current state value.
2. A function that allows you to update the state.

e.preventDefault()
 it is a method commonly used in event handlers to prevent the default
 behavior of an event. Events in web applications often have default behaviors associated with them.
  For example, when a form is submitted, the default behavior is to reload the page. 
  By calling e.preventDefault(),
 you can prevent this default behavior and handle the event in a custom way.


AuthContext

The code snippet export const AuthContext = createContext();
 is part of setting up a React context in a React application. 
Let's break down what each part of this line does:
1.createContext(): This is a function provided by React that creates a new context.
 A context in React is a way to share values, such as state or functions, 
 between components without having to pass them explicitly through each level of the component tree. 
 The createContext() function returns an object with a Provider and a Consumer.
2.AuthContext: This is a constant that is assigned the result of calling createContext().
 It represents the context object that will be used to share values related to authentication 
 throughout your React application.
